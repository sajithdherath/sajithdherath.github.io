I work as a Software Engineer in machine learning, and i believe in taking the extra time to create quality code from the beginning as it's a small initial investment that pays dividends in later maintenance and extension.
In my free time, i travel around sri lankaðŸ‡±ðŸ‡° with my camera, my mother country. I love photographyðŸ“· in nature, wildlife and landscapes. Check Gallery. I love reading books and finally hang with friends.
