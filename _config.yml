author_description: >-
  I am a Python backend engineer with 6 years of experience, dedicated to building reliable, high-performance systems that deliver results 
  every time. My recent work focuses on integrating large language models (LLMs), AI automation, and agentic workflows-ensuring that the 
  solutions I develop are both innovative and robust.<br><br>

  Through hands-on experience with scalable architectures, I have developed a strong command of the design patterns, frameworks, and tools essential 
  for dependable software at scale. I am committed to high-quality testing and rapid validation cycles, always striving to deliver solutions that 
  are both correct and efficient.<br><br>

  I enjoy tackling challenging problems at the intersection of backend engineering and artificial intelligence, and I’m always eager to 
  learn and apply the latest technologies.<br><br>

  Outside of work, I’m passionate about calisthenics, traveling, and capturing the beauty of nature through photography. 
  I value connecting with others and am always open to new ideas and collaborations.
